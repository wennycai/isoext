# A Sage implementation for [Faster algorithms for isogeny computations over extensions of finite fields]

The code is based on the research paper
[*Deuring for the People: Supersingular Elliptic Curves with Prescribed Endomorphism Ring in General Characteristic*](//ia.cr/2023/106)
by Jonathan Komada Eriksen, Lorenz Panny, Jana Sotáková, and Mattia Veroni.

This implementation contains 3 test files:
1. Tests for torsion basis generation in "test_torsionbasis.sage"
2. Tests for ideal to isogeny generation in "test_idealtoiso.sage"
3. Tests for constructive deuring correspondence in "test_deuring.sage"

For example,

Use
```
sage test_torsionbasis.sage
```
